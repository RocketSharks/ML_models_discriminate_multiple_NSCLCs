# ML_models_discriminate_multiple_NSCLCs

This repository contains the code and pre-trained machine learning models used for the study titled:

**"Development and validation of machine learning models based on molecular features for estimating the probability of multiple primary lung carcinoma versus intrapulmonary metastasis in patients presenting multiple non-small cell lung cancers."**

The study aims to assist in differentiating multiple primary lung carcinomas (MPLC) from intrapulmonary metastasis (IPM) in patients with multiple non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) using molecular data.

## Project Overview

This project presents the development and validation of several machine learning models (Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees) that classify whether multiple NSCLCs in a patient are MPLC or IPM based on molecular characteristics. These models were trained and validated using patient data including molecular features.
